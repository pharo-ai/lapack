A minimal FFI binding for LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) in Pharo.

For creating another binding to another method (or routine, because the library is written in Fortran), you only need to create a subclass of `LapackAlgorithm`. You can check `LapackDgelsd` as an example. 

_Note: We only tested this for MacOS. But it should work on Windows and Linux too. A prerequisite is to have already intalled the library on your OS. For making it work on Linux and Windows, is only needed to override the methods `unixLibraryName` and `win32LibraryName` to return the path in which the library is installed on your system. Check `LapackLibrary>>#macLibraryName`_

## How to install it?

To install `Lapack`, go to the Playground (Ctrl+OW) on your [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) image and execute the following Metacello script (select it and press Do-it button or Ctrl+D):

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'Lapack';
  repository: 'github://pharo-ai/lapack/src';
  load.
```

## How to depend on it?

If you want to add a dependency on `Lapack` to your project, include the following lines into your baseline method:

```Smalltalk
spec
  baseline: 'Lapack'
  with: [ spec repository: 'github://pharo-ai/lapack/src' ].
```

If you are new to baselines and Metacello, check out the [Baselines](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki/blob/master/General/Baselines.md) tutorial on Pharo Wiki.

## How to use it?

Currently, we only bound one routine: `dgelsd()` in the class `LapackDgelsd`

This algorithm computes the minimum-norm solution to a linear least squares problem double precision GE matrices. If you don't know about lapack nor about the least squares problem, please see the class comment (`LapackDgelsd`). For now, we are going to continue the explanation assuming that the reader knows about it.

To use the method, you need to pass two matrices: `matrixA` and `matrixB`. The object needs to understand the messages `contentsForLapack` and `contentsForLapackOfAtLeast:`. Those methods are implemented in `Collection`. So, you can pass an array for example.

Be careful, this is the binding for the fortran lapack and it expects that the matrices are flattened in a column-major form. If you want to use this library in a high-level way, we strongly recomend using the [linear-algebra](https://github.com/pharo-ai/linear-algebra) library of pharo-ai. It uses this lapack binding for solving the least square algorithm and it provides a nicer API and also has the matrices data structures that are internally store the elements already flattened in a column-major way and that you can use directly.

### Code example

For example, you can use the `LapackDgelsd` algorithm in the following way:

```st
matrixA := #( 0.12 -6.91 -3.33  3.97 -8.19
              2.22 -8.94  3.33  7.69 -5.12
             -6.72 -2.74 -2.26 -9.08 -4.40
             -7.92 -4.71  9.96 -9.98 -3.20 ).
matrixB := #( 7.30  1.33  2.68 -9.62 0.00
              0.47  6.58 -1.71 -0.79 0.00
             -6.28 -3.42  3.46  0.41 0.00 ).

algorithm := LapackDgelsd new
    numberOfRows: 4;
    numberOfColumns: 5;
    numberOfRightHandSides: 3;
    matrixA: matrixA;
    matrixB: matrixB;
    yourself.
